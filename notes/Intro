Telemetry:
===========

-> automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a
differnt location for monitory and analysis.

-> eg: number of event received per minute.


Grafana:
==========

-> bring data from different datasource together.
-> defines alerts.

Grafana datasouces:
======================
-> grafana will not store telemetry data. It just visualize the telemetry data.
-> so, we need some datasource for the grafana to pull data.
-> It can pull from variefy of souces such as mysql, sql sever, graphite, elasticsearch.,etc.,


Graphite:
=========

-> its one the datasource for storing the telemetric data.
-> predominanaly used for storing telemetric data.
-> its free and open source.
-> Data in graphite is stored in buckets.
-> bucket is collection of telemetry data.
-> bucket tree is identified by a "." character. eg: shoes.loafers.count
-> counter bukcet is increased by the value it receives.
-> gaugle bucket value is set by the value it receives.
-> timer bucket is set by the value it receives.


StatsD:
========

-> to send data to graphite, we need to setup socket connection and other overhead is there.
-> used for collection data and passing them to graphite.
-> data is sent as plain text. by default works on udp protocol.
-> data format <bucket>:<value>|Type   . eg: sales.jackets:1|c
